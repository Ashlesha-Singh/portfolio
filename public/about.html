<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! my name is Ashlesha Singh. I'm a passionate and detail-oriented web developer with a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies. I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how the web works, which soon turned into a full-blown passion for building intuitive and efficient digital experiences.</p><br>

<p> I enjoy turning ideas into reality through clean and structured code. Whether it’s a sleek landing page, a dynamic dashboard, or a full-stack web application, I strive to build solutions that are both functional and visually engaging. I’ve worked on various personal and academic projects, collaborating in teams and individually, and I’m always eager to explore new tools, frameworks, and trends in modern web development.</p><br>

<p>Beyond coding, I value continuous learning, teamwork, and clear communication. I believe that great products are built not just with code but with empathy for users and a deep understanding of their needs. I’m excited to contribute to impactful projects and grow alongside developers who share the same passion for building better web experiences.</p><br>
